## Overview

This Tableau project is designed to analyze and visualize electric vehicle (EV) data. The dashboard provides insights into various aspects such as sales trends, geographic distribution, and other key metrics relevant to the EV industry.

## Features

- **Sales Trends Analysis**: Visualize the trends in EV sales over time, highlighting key periods of growth or decline.
- **Geographic Distribution**: Understand the distribution of EV sales across different regions, identifying hotspots and underperforming areas.
- **Market Segmentation**: Analyze sales data by different segments, such as vehicle types, manufacturers, or price ranges.
- **Comparative Analysis**: Compare EV sales against traditional vehicles, highlighting the shift in consumer preferences.

## Data Sources

The dashboard is built using the following data sources:

- **EV Sales Data**: Data on the number of electric vehicles sold over a period.
- **Geographic Data**: Information about the regions where the vehicles were sold.
- **Market Data**: Additional data providing context, such as overall vehicle sales or economic indicators.

## Visualizations

The dashboard includes several key visualizations:

1. **Time Series Analysis**: A line chart showing EV sales over time.
2. **Geographic Heatmap**: A map visualization indicating sales volumes across different regions.
3. **Bar Charts**: Displaying sales by manufacturer, vehicle type, etc.
4. **Comparative Pie Charts**: Comparing the share of EVs to traditional vehicles in the market.

# PROBLEM STATEMENT -

	## KPI'S Requirement	
 	### Total Vehicles:
	- Understand the overall landscape of electric vehicles, encompassing both BEVs and PHEVs, to assess the market's size and growth.

	### Average Electric Range:
	- Determine the average electric range of the electric vehicles in the dataset to gauge the technological advancements and efficiency of the EVs.

	### Total BEV Vehicles and % of Total BEV Vehicles:
